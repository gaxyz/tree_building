# Treee Building

This is a repo that contains a pipeline for tree building and comparison of orthologous genes.

The pipelines here are not really robust in terms of data structure and naming, so special care must be taken when running it. For example, unaligned multifasta filenames should contain **only one** dot ("."), like `*.faa`.
